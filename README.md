#Plex Request Channel
##A Plex Channel to manage requests

Plex Request Channel will allow you to manage requests from your users directly from within Plex Media Server.

Users can search for Movies or TV Shows from the Open Movie DataBase, the Movie Database, or the TVDB and based on the site, posters with show descriptions will be returned. From there shows can be saved to a request list, which can be viewed later.

Couchpotato and Sonarr support is integrated for direct management and automation.
Pushbullet and Pushover support is also included for notifications whenever a new request is made.


To install this channel, you can either clone the bundle using git, or download the file directly from Github and then place the .bundle folder in your Plex Plugins folder. Refer to the following Plex Support pages for more information.
