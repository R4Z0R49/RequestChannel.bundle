Plex Request Channel - A Plex Channel to create requests

Plex Request Channel will allow you to manage requests from your users directly from within Plex Media Server.

Users can search for Movies or TV Shows from the Open Movie DataBase, the Movie Database, or the TVDB and based on the site, posters with show descriptions will be returned. From there shows can be saved to a request list, which can be viewed later.

There is also integration with couchpotato and sonarr so requests can be sent for downloading directly from within the channel.

Pushbullet and Pushover support is also included so you can be notified whenever a new request has been made.
